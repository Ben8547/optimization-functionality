A collection of custom functions usful for optomization of processes.

In the file DerivativeFunctionality.py find several finite difference derivative schemes as well as an general function using interpolation polynomial to construct and n^th order finite difference derivative approximation.

In InterpolatingPolynomials.py find functions constructing interpolation polynomials and their derivatives.

In NonLinearSolvers find function perfoming Newton's method and the secant method for finding roots of equations. These are additionaly generalized to systems of equations.

In SpectralDerivatives.py functions estimating derivatives with Fourier transforms are present. Additional functions may be added using standard spectral formulas.

In simulatedAnnealing.py find a function which uses Markov chains and the Metroplis algorithm to estimate the **global** extrema of a function by treating as the energy of some physical system with a Bolzmann distrobution.

tests.ipynb contains some examples of the functions and tests to ensure proper functionality.
